## Features ##

Should provide quick access to the following for a type:

1. methods
  1. Allow searching by name, param types, flags and return types
  1. Include implicit conversion methods?
1. constructors
  1. Allow searching by param types
1. classes
1. baseclasses [x]
1. subclasses
1. implicits (across the companion as well) [x]
1. Final type
1. Alias (if any)

----

1. List members of a package. (works only with preloaded packages like scala. Use a library to get this functionality)
2. Find package of a type (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21428795/scala-reflection-derive-package-name)
3. reflective find a type that satisfies a relationship within a hierarchy/package (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18247002/scala-reflection-search)
4. Given a method name, return the class in which it is defined/overridden

----

Issues:

1. Some methods that return generic types return a type 'T' when the methods take in a different letter such as 'A':

members[scala.math.Ordering.type].methodsByName("ordered").methodSignature.nl.print

gives:
    def ordered[A](evidence$1: A => Comparable[A]): Ordering[T]

This seems to be a reflection API issue. If we use Type.toString we get the correct Answer. This might be a workaround we need. [x]

2. All implicit does not return implicit instances, only implicit classes and methods.

Features:

1. Add a ClassSignature class for printing out classes [x]

2. Add a ModuleSignature class for printing out modules [x]

3. Have a default profile to reduce verbosity of dsl:

    methods[T].defaults -> should be the same as:
    methods[T].methodSignature.sortAlpha.num.print

4. Add methodName Transform implicit. (MethodNameOps)

5. Add the ability to list members of a module. [x]

6. Add the ability to list members of a class. [x]

7. Rename <init> -> The name of the class. [x]

8. Add deprecated modifier to classes, modules and methods. [x]

9. Add .summary format to display a summary of a type:
    1. methods
    2. classes
    3. modules

    Similar to .info but more usable.

10. Return implicit instances available.

11. List methods of type such as Option should take into account any implicit conversions in its companion object and scala.Predef.

12. Add a 'rType' and 'symbol' variables to each type and symbol respectively.

13. Add a ValSignature class for printing out Vals. [x]

14. Add a VarSignature class for printing out Vars. [x]

15. All type-like classes should have all type-related functionality. (methods, classes, superclasses, subclasses) [x]

16. MethodSignature should specify whether it is an implicit. [x]
